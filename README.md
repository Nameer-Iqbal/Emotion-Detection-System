# Emotion-Detection-System
In today's advanced technological landscape, emotion detection systems are crucial across various fields, from healthcare to entertainment. These systems interpret human emotions through facial expressions, promoting more natural interactions between people and machines. A fundamental aspect of these systems is the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and classification.

Emotion detection from facial expressions involves several key steps: data collection, preprocessing, model training, and real-time prediction. Each step must be carefully executed to ensure the system's accuracy and reliability. The growing availability of large datasets and advancements in deep learning have enabled the development of highly accurate emotion detection systems.

Our project aims to create a scalable emotion detection application using CNNs and OpenCV. The primary objective is to develop a reliable and efficient system for real-time emotion detection. By utilizing pre-trained models and OpenCV's capabilities, the application can perform tasks such as real-time video analysis and emotion classification. Furthermore, the project highlights the significance of preprocessing steps, including image normalization and face detection, to enhance model accuracy.
